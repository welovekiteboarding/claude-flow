# Chess Game Enhancement and Bug Fix Summary

## Issues Identified and Resolved

### 1. Script Loading Order Issue
**Problem**: The index.html file was referencing `ultimate-debug.js` which didn't exist, causing a 404 error.
**Fix**: Removed the reference to `ultimate-debug.js` from index.html, ensuring only the required scripts are loaded:
- chess.js (chess engine)
- ChessGame.js (game logic wrapper)
- script-enhanced.js (UI interactions)

### 2. "That's not your piece!" Error
**Problem**: Persistent error where players couldn't select any pieces, always getting "That's not your piece!" message.
**Root Cause**: Inconsistent color representation between:
- chess.js library uses 'w' and 'b' for piece colors
- ChessGame.js and UI code expected 'white' and 'black' for player turns
- Comparison logic was directly comparing 'w' with 'white' (always false)

**Fix**: Updated piece selection functions in `script-enhanced.js` to properly convert piece colors:
- `handlePieceClick()` - Added proper color conversion before comparison
- `handleSquareClick()` - Added proper color conversion before comparison
- `handleDragStart()` - Already had correct color conversion (kept as is)

### 3. Logic Flow Issues
**Problem**: Incorrect conditional logic in piece selection functions.
**Fix**: Restructured the piece selection logic to:
1. First check if it's the computer's turn (in player vs computer mode)
2. Then check if a piece exists at the clicked position
3. Convert the piece color from chess.js format ('w'/'b') to UI format ('white'/'black')
4. Compare with current player to determine if selection is allowed

## Key Code Changes

### In `script-enhanced.js`:

#### handlePieceClick() - Before:
```javascript
// Incorrect direct comparison
if (piece && piece.color === boardState.currentPlayer) {
    // Select the piece
}
```

#### handlePieceClick() - After:
```javascript
// Correct color conversion and comparison
if (piece) {
    const pieceColor = piece.color === 'w' ? 'white' : 'black';
    if (pieceColor !== boardState.currentPlayer) {
        showTemporaryMessage("That's not your piece!");
        return;
    }
    // Select the piece
    chessGame.selectedSquare = { row, col };
}
```

#### handleSquareClick() - Before:
```javascript
// Incorrect direct comparison
else if (piece && piece.color === boardState.currentPlayer) {
    // Select the piece
}
```

#### handleSquareClick() - After:
```javascript
// Correct color conversion and comparison
else if (piece) {
    const pieceColor = piece.color === 'w' ? 'white' : 'black';
    if (pieceColor === boardState.currentPlayer) {
        // Select the piece
        chessGame.selectedSquare = { row, col };
        renderBoard();
    } else {
        showTemporaryMessage("That's not your piece!");
    }
}
```
